        question: "How much product does it hold?",
        answer: "The BioSafe Home unit holds 4 separate 3 ounce (by volume) containers, for a total of ½ ounce (by weight) of organic material.  Larger units are available"
      },
      {
        question: "Does it affect the taste?",
        answer: "No, the BioSafe does not affect the taste of any organic material."
      },
      {
        question: "I live in a dry area.  Will it increase the humidity until it is at the proper level?",
        answer: "The BioSafe is capable of raising the humidity of the storage chamber to the desired level in any environment with an average relative humidity of at least 15%.  This covers most of the cities in North America.  For environments with an average relative humidity of less than 15%, an optional humidity boost system is available."
      },
      {
        question: "I live in a humid area.  Will it decrease the humidity until it is at the proper level?",
        answer: "Yes, the BioSafe is capable of lowering the humidity of the storage chamber to the desired level in any environment with an average relative humidity of less than 95%."
      },
      {
        question: "I live in a humid area.  Why do I need a BioSafe to store organic material?",
        answer: "Humidity over the desired level can create conditions of mold growth.  Consumption of moldy organic material is particularly problematic, and at minimum, can cause severe headaches."
      },
      {
        question: "I live in an area with high temperature.  How can the BioSafe help me?",
        answer: "Moderate to high temperature, especially in conjunction with relative humidity exceeding 65%, sets up the ideal conditions for mold growth in organic material.  To combat this, the BioSafe is available with an optional temperature control module."
      },
      {
        question: "Does the BioSafe make noise?",
        answer: "The BioSafe contains a whisper quiet air mover.  It is possible to hear the air moving, but only if you are within a few inches of the unit."
      },
      {
        question: "How much power does the BioSafe use?",
        answer: "The BioSafe Home uses less than 5 watts of power and plugs into a standard 1A (or more) cell phone charger."
      },
      {
        question: "What are the dimensions?",

      },
      {
        question: "What is the warranty period?",
        answer: "The BioSafe Home is warranted for 1 year against defects in material or workmanship.  An extended warranty program is also available.  Contact CFS for additional information."
      },
      {
        question: "Is it available in different colors?",
        answer: "The standard unit has a stainless steel body with a black base and black lid.  Optional colors for the base and lid are available."
      },
      {
        question: "What do the different colored lights mean?",
        answer: "The BioSafe Home has a single indicator that changes color to indicate the status of the storage chamber.  Green indicates the system is increasing the humidity of the storage chamber.  Red indicates the system is decreasing the humidity, and blue indicates that the storage chamber is at the target humidity.  One of these three colors is always displayed when the unit is powered."
      },
      {
        question: "I see how the BioSafe can keep my organics at the proper humidity and temperature, but can the BioSafe keep my organics secure?",
        answer: "The BioSafe Home comes with a built-in combination lock on the cover, which can be set to any 4 digit sequence you desire."
